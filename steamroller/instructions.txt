Steam Roller

Flatten a nested array. You must account for varying levels of nesting.

steamrollerArr([[["a]], [["b"]]]) should return ["a", "b"]
steamrollerArr([1, [2], [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4]
steamrollerArr([1, [], [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, 3, 4]
steamrollerArr([1, {}, [3, [[4]]]]) should return [1, {}, 3, 4]

Your solution should not usse the Array.prototype.flat() or
Array.prototype.flatMap() methods

Global variables shold not be used

Logical explanation.


Function takes an input array, loops through its elements, and for each element:

If the element is an array, the function calls itself recursively with the element as an
argument. This step continues until the element is no longer an array.

If the element is not an array, the element is aded to the result array using 
'result.push(arr[i])'.

The result of the current call is then concatenated with the result of previous calls using 
'result = result.concat(flattenArray(arr[i]))
Finally the result  array is returned and it contains all elements of the input arrayflattened into a single dimension.
